# COSX
Base System Repo for COSX

COSX is an emulated rendition of MacOS that can be used on any machine.  COSX uses QEMU/KVM as the accelerator.

Script files are kept in the directory 'COSX-Script-Launchers' and are easy to use.

Obviously Dork Hub did not invent MacOS nor QEMU/KVM so credit goes where credit is deserved.  

Dork Hub uses a rusty trombone reach around image grab technique to aquire a recovery image from Apple Computers Inc.  

THIS SOFTWARE ID FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEBUGGING ONLY!!!!!
NOTE*** Do whatever you want with it though, its pretty badass.

Happy Hacking!

If your name is Mrs. Mina, Please run 'Mina-Script' within the 'COSX-Script-Launchers' directory. :)
